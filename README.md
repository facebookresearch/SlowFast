## Introduction

The goal of PySlowFast is to provide a high-performance, light-weight pytorch codebase provides state-of-the-art video backbones for video understanding research on different tasks (classification, detection, and etc). It is designed in order to support rapid implementation and evaluation of novel video research ideas. PySlowFast includes implementations of the following backbone network architectures:

- SlowFast
- Slow
- C2D
- I3D
- Non-local Network
- X3D

## Updates
 - We now support [X3D Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04730). See [`projects/x3d`](./projects/x3d/README.md) for more information.
 - We now support [Multigrid Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00998) for efficiently training video models. See [`projects/multigrid`](./projects/multigrid/README.md) for more information.
 - PySlowFast is released in conjunction with our [ICCV 2019 Tutorial](https://alexander-kirillov.github.io/tutorials/visual-recognition-iccv19/).

## Model Zoo and Baselines

We provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the PySlowFast [Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Installation

Please find installation instructions for PyTorch and PySlowFast in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). You may follow the instructions in [DATASET.md](slowfast/datasets/DATASET.md) to prepare the datasets.

## Quick Start

Follow the example in [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) to start playing video models with PySlowFast.

## Visualization Tools

We offer a range of visualization tools for the train/eval/test processes, model analysis, and for running inference with trained model.
